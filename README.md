# Random Word Generator 
Our generator produces lengths that follow the **shifted Poisson** distribution.

# Memory Usage

### Trie Using RobinHood hashing
**Instance of Element**: 8 bytes (2x4 ints) + 12 byte header = 20 bytes. But becuase Java objects are aligned to an 8-byte boundary = **24 Bytes**

**Instance of TrieNode**: (5x4 int) + (2x4 byte references) + 12 byte header = **40 bytes**

**Total Memory Usage** = N x [(Instance of Element + Instance of TrieNode) + (12 bytes + (arraySize x 4 bytes)]  + nullPointers x 4 bytes = N x [(40 bytes + 24 bytes) +(12 bytes + (size x 4 bytes) ] + nullPointers x 4 bytes 
> N: number ob trie nodes.


### Trie Static (Simple)
**Instance of TrieNode:** 12 bytes (3x4 byes int) + 4 bytes (children reference)  + 12 byte (header) = 28 bytes = 28 bytes.

## Conclusion
##### Dynamic Version:
It is observed that memory management is efficient, but as the number of words increases, more memory is required.

##### Static Version:
It is observed that as the number of words increases, slightly less memory is required. However, it still uses more memory overall compared to the dynamic version.

##### Effect of Word Length:
The experiment shows that word length plays a significant role in memory usage. If the words are shorter, there are more common prefixes, which consequently lead to reduced memory usage.

##### Overall:
We conclude that regardless of the size of each word or the number of words, the dynamic implementation is always better than the static one in terms of memory usage.
